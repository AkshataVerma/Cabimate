It is a digital data locker , an open source document management system (DMS) primarily designed for archiving and retrieving your digital documents. Instead of having piles of paper documents all over your desk, office or drawers - you can quickly scan them and configure your scanner to directly upload to the DMS. You can upload your scanned documents in any form like pdf, docx, docs, image (any format) etc. It aims at ‘Digital Empowerment’ of citizen by providing access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digital document wallet.  This is web-based software. This means there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web browser.
